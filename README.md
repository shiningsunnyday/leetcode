Everyone hates how LeetCode is stingy with providing test cases, right?

Fortunately, this script can mass generate test cases (random 1d vectors, 2d vectors, binary trees, strings, etc.) in a way compatible with LeetCode's formatting. It can then compare your outputs with LeetCode provided answers and print the ones with incorrect outputs so you can try to work backwards to your code. 

I especially find it productive first generating 100 "small" cases (e.g. vector lengths 1-5) to debug edge cases faster before mass generating 1000 large cases to check for time limit exceeded.  Then, I can submit with confidence!
